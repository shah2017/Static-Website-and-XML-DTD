<h1>Introduction to NBA</h1>
              <div class="contentText">
			  <div id="text"><p><b>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the major men's professional basketball league in North America, 
		     and is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.
		     It has 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada), and is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), 
		     which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for 
		     basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.
		     NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player. The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, 
		     as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, 
		     after merging with its rival National Basketball League (NBL). The league's several international as well as individual team offices are 
		     directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City.
		     NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.<br>
			 The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern 
			 United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, 
			 in a game the NBA now regards as the first played in its history. The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. 
			 Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA
			 was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA 
			 was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, 
			 the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won 
			 the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the 
			 BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.
             Following the 1948–49 season, the BAA took in the remainder of the NBL: Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo. 
			 In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed from the BAA to the National Basketball 
			 Association in spite of having the same BAA governing body including Podoloff. The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of 
			 large and small cities, as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a 
			 process that continued until 1953–54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, 
			 Philadelphia Warriors, Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, Fort Wayne Pistons, Tri-Cities Blackhawks, and Syracuse Nationals, all of which 
			 remain in the league today. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from 
			 the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951, and then to St. Louis in 1955. The Rochester Royals moved from Rochester, New York, to Cincinnati in 1957 
			 and the Pistons relocated from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Detroit in 1957.
			 Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks. 
			 He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington 
			 Capitols in 1950. Hunter was cut from the team during training camp, but several African-American players did play in the 
			 league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the 
			 Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established 
			 themselves as the league's first dynasty. To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock 
			 in 1954. If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining 
			 the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.<br>
			 The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations currently consists of 30 teams.
			 The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada. The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences 
			 of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season. Reflecting the population 
			 distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the 
			 Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.
