			<div id="text"><p><b>The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations currently 
			consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada. The current league organization divides thirty teams 
			into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season. 
			Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: 
			thirteen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.
			</p>
			<p>The Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association is made up of 15 teams, organized in three divisions.
            The three division winners and the non-division winner with the best record are seeded 1 through 4 for the playoffs in order of their records, 
			with all remaining non-division winners seeded 5 through 8. This leaves open the possibility that a #2 or #3 seed could be a non-division winner. 
			Home-court advantage in a playoff series is decided by record, not by seeding, so if the #4 and #5 teams meet in a playoff series in which 
			the #5 team has the better record, the #5 team would have home-court advantage.
            The reasoning behind this seeding arrangement is that a non-division winner could have a better record than the winners of the two divisions 
			other than the non-division winning team in question. If the three division winners were seeded 1 through 3 for the playoffs in order of their 
			records, and all non-division winners seeded 4 through 8, it would be possible for the two best teams of the conference to meet in the 
			Conference Semifinals. This actually happened in the 2006 NBA Playoffs when the two best teams in the Western Conference, the San Antonio Spurs 
			and the Dallas Mavericks, both from the Southwest Division, faced one another in the Western Conference Semifinals while the 3rd seed, 
			the Northwest Division-leading Denver Nuggets, had fewer wins than the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th seeds.The NBA proposed and approved of the current 
			format to ensure that the best two teams of a conference can meet no earlier than the Conference Finals.
            The Eastern Conference playoffs are divided into two preliminary rounds followed by the Eastern Conference Finals, with the winner of 
			the Conference Championship facing the Western Conference champion in the NBA Finals to determine the champion. All playoff series are 
			best-of-seven. The current divisional alignment was adopted at the start of the 2004–05 season, when the now Charlotte Hornets began play as 
			the NBA's 30th franchise. This necessitated the move of the New Orleans Pelicans from the Eastern Conference's Central Division to the newly 
			created Southwest Division of the Western Conference.</b>
